# Browser-Extension-for-Real-Time-Detection-of-Phishing-and-Pirate-Websites-Using-Machine-Learning
The study develops a real-time detection system embedded into a browser extension to mitigate the growing threat posed by phishing and pirate websites. As traditional detection mechanisms have proven to be weaker accomplices against the growing sophistication of cyber threats, ML techniques emerged as the ways to overcome such limitations. The study involves development of a browser extension that employs a logistic regression model built on a clean dataset of legitimate and malicious websites. Core lexical, structural, and content-based features are extracted to distinguish safe from harmful sites. The trained model is compiled into the browser extension for live scanning and alerting. The system's performance was evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score and was found to effectively identify malicious websites. To provide qualitative feedback about the extension's usability and trustworthiness, user interviews were conducted as well. The results reveal that the ML-based detection method greatly enhances detection accuracy and user experience compared to the traditional methods. This study underlines the potential of implementing ML models within browser extensions to fortify cyber security measures, and it recommends further research into implementing additional advanced features and further optimizing the interface design.
